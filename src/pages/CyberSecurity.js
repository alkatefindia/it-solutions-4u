        Cybersecurity is the field of protecting data, networks, and computer systems
        from online threats, loss, and damage. It entails putting rules in place to
        protect IT assets and guaranteeing data availability, confidentiality, and
        integrity. A variety of tools, procedures, and practices are included in
        cybersecurity strategies to protect against ransomware, phishing scams,
        infections, and unauthorized access.
