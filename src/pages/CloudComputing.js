          <b> Private </b> - A dedicated cloud infrastructure utilized just by
          one company is referred to as private cloud computing. It keeps
          improved security and control while providing cloud technology
          advantages like scalability and resource efficiency. Private clouds,
          in comparison to public clouds, offer a more customized and private
          computing environment because they are not shared with other users.
          Businesses with certain regulatory needs or worries about sensitive
          data frequently choose this arrangement.

        <p><b> Hybrid </b> - A computer system known as hybrid cloud computing blends public and private

            across various cloud environments. With this strategy, companies may take advantage
            of private and public cloud computing advantages while keeping control over sensitive
